            In a world where communication is immediate and ideas flow at the speed of a click,
            Y was born with the mission of connecting people through short but powerful messages.
            Our platform offers a free and accessible space where every user can share thoughts, 
            news, and emotions in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
            We are guided by transparency, safety, and respect, building a digital community where 
            freedom of expression is balanced with responsibility. We want Y to be more than a 
            social platform: a place where connections matter, where stories inspire, and where 
            every user has the power to be heard.
